The cat sat on the mat and watched the dog chase the ball. The cat was bored, but the dog was having fun. The cat wished that it could join in the fun, but it was too lazy to get up. The dog chased the ball all over the yard, but it couldn't catch it. The cat just sat there and watched, and eventually the dog gave up and went back to the cat. The cat was still bored, but it was at least amused by the dog's antics.
